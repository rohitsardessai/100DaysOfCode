A P J Abdul Kalam;Ignited Minds;The Invention of Nature reveals the extraordinary life of the visionary German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) and how he created the way we understand nature today. Though almost forgotten today, his name lingers everywhere from the Humboldt Current to the Humboldt penguin. Humboldt was an intrepid explorer and the most famous scientist of his age. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether climbing the highest volcanoes in the world, paddling down the Orinoco or racing through anthrax–infested Siberia. 
J K Rowling;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone;This book sets out to restore Humboldt to his rightful place in the pantheon of natural scientists. In the process, Wulf does a great deal more. This meticulously researched work – part biography, part cabinet of curiosities – takes us on an exhilarating armchair voyage through some of the world’s least hospitable regions, from the steaming Amazon basin to the ice-fringed peaks of Kazakhstan.
Chetan Bhagat;Half Girlfriend;Evocative descriptions of his expeditions,delightful stories,Wulf’s stories of wilderness adventure and academic exchange flow easily, and her affection for von Humboldt is contagious.
Paulo Coelho;The Alchemist;Galambos was an astrophysicist and philosopher who developed a psychological theory that seeks to maximize human peace and freedom. While Galambos had much in common with his classical liberal contemporaries, his most unique contributions concerned his theories on intellectual property, and his advocacy of a stateless society totally free of coercion, political or otherwise.
J K Rowling;The Silkworm;As Andrea Wulf remarks in her arresting The Invention of Nature her book is readable, thoughtful and widely researched, and informed by German sources richer than the English canon. It is the first formal biography for many years and may go some way to returning this strange genius to the public.
A P J Abdul Kalam;Turning points;Thrilling new biography,Wulf’s book is as much a history of those ideas as it is of the man. The man may be lost but his ideas have never been more alive.In our Anthropocene age Humboldt’s theories read like prophecy. More important, they offer wisdom about the way forward. It is impossible to read The Invention of Nature without contracting Humboldt fever. Wulf makes Humboldtians of us all.At times The Invention of Nature reads like pulp explorer fiction She has gone to near-Humboldtian lengths to research her book.
Paulo Coelho;Eleven Minutes;A cognitive error is often committed by confusing a behavior, feeling, belief or fantasy with a real entity! It is confusing an action with the actor. A person may mistake behavior for the entity exhibiting the behavior.  It is an extremely common cognitive fallacy among theists.
Chetan Bhagat;Five Point Someone;This is a big book about a big subject, written with scholarship and enthusiasm A book that may help restore his well- deserved reputation as the father of environmentalism the phrase ‘lost hero of science’ in the subtitle of her book is no exaggeration.
J K Rowling;The Casual Vacancy;The gist of my praise is simple. Wulf recognized not only a good story but also an important one. She has written a fascinating book about a fascinating man whose work influences our thinking even though his name is no longer widely remembered Wulf’s book is about a long-dead great man but also about ourselves.
A P J Abdul Kalam;Indomitable Spirit;Wulf, a historian with an invaluable environmental perspective, presents with zest and eloquence the full story of Humboldt’s adventurous life and extraordinary achievements Humboldt, Wulf convincingly argues in this enthralling, elucidating biography, was a genuine visionary, whose insights we need now more than ever.
J K Rowling;Career of Evil;This is a truly wonderful book. Andrea Wulf has told the tale with such brio, such understanding, such depth. The physical journeyings, all around South America when it was virtually terra incognita, are as exciting as the journeys of Humboldt’s mind into astronomy, literature, philosophy and every known branch of science. This is one of the most exciting intellectual biographies I have ever read, up there with Lewes’s Goethe and Ray Monk’s Wittgenstein. Hoorah, hoorah!.
A P J Abdul Kalam;Wings of Fire;Perceiving nature as an interconnected global force, Humboldt discovered similarities between climate zones across the world and predicted human-induced climate change. He turned scientific observation into poetic narrative, and his writings inspired naturalists and poets such as Darwin, Wordsworth and Goethe but also politicians such as Jefferson. Wulf also argues that it was Humboldt’s influence that led John Muir to his ideas of preservation and that shaped Thoreau’s ‘Walden’. Wulf traces Humboldt’s influences through the great minds he inspired in revolution, evolution, ecology, conservation, art and literature.  In The Invention of Nature Wulf brings this lost hero to science and the forgotten father of environmentalism back to life.
Chetan Bhagat;2 States;Marvellous book should go a long way towards putting this captivating eighteenth century German scientist, traveller and opinion-shaper back at the heart of the way we look at the world which Humboldt helped to interpret, and whose environmental problems he predicted. She has captured the excitement and intimacy of his experiences within the pages of this irresistible and consistently absorbing life of a man whose discoveries have shaped the way we see.
Paulo Coelho;The Devil and Miss Prym;Reification is the type of cognitive error caused when an abstraction is mistaken for a concrete,real event, or physical entity. In other words, it is the error of treating as a ‘real thing’ something, which is not a real thing, but merely an idea or a fantasy. Reification is generally accepted in literature where  reified abstractions are intended metaphorically, whereas the use of reification in logic is a cognitive mistake.
