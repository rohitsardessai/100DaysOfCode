# 100 Days of Code

![Thou shalt commit](https://i.imgflip.com/7o413l.jpg)
## Description

100 days of code is a public challenge where you commit to coding every day for a hundred days. More info on that [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

This repo is my documentation of that journey, and also a way to keep myself motivated to stick to it. I'm hoping it will also double as an archive or useful snippets that I can refer back to whenever needed. 

## Thanks

Huge thanks to [John Washam](https://github.com/jwasham). His repos [practice-c](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c) and [practice-cpp](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp) have been hugely helpful in supporting my learning of these subjects.

Other great resources include the [CS50 lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382_R182iC2gNZI9HzWFMC_8) which are available on a variety of platforms including YouTube.
