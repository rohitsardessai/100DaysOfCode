# 100 Days of Code

![Thou shalt commit](https://i.imgflip.com/7o413l.jpg)
## Description

100 days of code is a public challenge where you commit to coding every day for a hundred days. More info on that [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

This repo is my documentation of that journey, and also a way to keep myself motivated to stick to it. I'm hoping it will also double as an archive or useful snippets that I can refer back to whenever needed.
